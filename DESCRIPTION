Description: Provides an R client for 'AstraeaDB', a cloud-native graph database
    with vector search capabilities. Supports node and edge CRUD operations,
    graph traversals (BFS, shortest path), temporal queries, vector similarity
    search, hybrid graph-vector search, 'GQL' query execution, and
    'GraphRAG' (subgraph extraction with LLM integration). Communicates with
    the 'AstraeaDB' server over a JSON-over-TCP protocol. An optional
    'Apache Arrow Flight' transport is available for high-performance bulk
    operations when the 'arrow' package is installed.
